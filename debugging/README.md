# ChatGPT Debugging & Automation Project

Welcome to this specialized module of our IT curriculum where we explore innovative ways to integrate **artificial intelligence** into everyday coding practices.  

This project focuses on two pivotal aspects of software development: **debugging** and **automation**.  
By working with ChatGPT, you will learn how to identify and fix errors more efficiently, and how to automate repetitive coding tasks â€” making your workflow smarter, faster, and more efficient.

## Objectives

### Debugging
- Use AI to identify and solve coding errors.  
- Diagnose and correct bugs across multiple programming languages (Python, HTML/JS).  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills and understanding of common pitfalls.  

### Automation
- Automate repetitive coding tasks (boilerplate, documentation, basic unit tests).  
- Focus on more complex and creative aspects of development.  

---

## Expected Outcomes
- **Enhanced Debugging Skills**: Confidence in troubleshooting and refining code with AI support.  
- **Automation Proficiency**: Ability to leverage AI for repetitive tasks, producing more structured and error-free code.
